# RandomServices

Here's where I put random `.service` files

## OpenRGB

Starts the OpenRGB AppImage in server mode instead of standalone. In standalone, I have to wait a few extra seconds for the colors to change if I use a profile.

If you are going to use this, make sure you put your OpenRGB.AppImage or other executable in `/usr/local/bin/` and put your username and group in the service file instead of the template.
